# Testing speed of tree_sort
- I've used different gcc optimization flags to compile (Os,O0..).
- Wrote a makefile which compiles C files, then runs them and draws a plot (using gnuplot)
- Spoiler : As we can see from the 'tree_sort_out.pdf', the algorithm slightly depends on the optimization flags :(
